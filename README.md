# VMS-datacall

This script has been developed in collaboration with the ICES working group [WGSFD](http://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGSFD.aspx "Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data") to aid technical personnel of countries in successfully submitting data to comply with the   [2016 ICES Data call for VMS/Log book data for fishing activities in the North East Atlantic and Baltic Sea over the years 2009-2015](http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/Data_calls/20160115_VMS_data_call_2016.pdf). Users please note: this R-script is offered as an aid for countries to use and not mandatory, the responsibility lies with individual countries to meet the 2016 ICES Data call for VMS/Log book data. Given the nature of GitHub and the r-environment, ICES cannot take responsibility for any mistakes, updates or corrections. The script has been, and is being developed, as a community driven initiative to help guide data submitters in an iterative way to meet the 2016 ICES VMS/Log book data call.
